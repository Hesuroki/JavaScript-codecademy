1.Let's practice adding some code comments.
To the right, we've provided you with the beginning of the book Catch-22 by Joseph Heller.
On line 1, write a single line comment that says Opening line.


2.Single line comments are great for adding context to your code. Multi-line comments are often best suited to prevent a block of code from running. However, both types of comments can be used for either purpose.

Use a multi-line comment so that the console.log() statements on lines 4 - 9 are commented out. */
