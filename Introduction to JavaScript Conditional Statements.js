Below the sale variable declaration, but before the if statement, reassign sale to false. Run your code and observe what happens, we’ll be changing this behavior in the next exercise

After you press run, play around with the condition by tweaking the comparison of hungerLevel by using different operators such as <=,>=,>, and <.

In main.js there are two variables mood and tirednessLevel.
Let’s create an if...else statement that checks if mood is 'sleepy' and tirednessLevel is greater than 8.
If both conditions evaluate to true, then console.log() the string 'time to sleep'. Otherwise, we should console.log() 'not bed time yet'.
After you press “Run”, play around with the || operator and the ! operator! What happens if you negate the value of the entire statement with ! and switch to || instead of &&?

Assign to writingUtensil the value of tool and if tool is falsy, assign a default value of 'pen'.

Notice that text 'The pen is mightier than the sword' logged to the console. Which means the value of writingUtensil is 'pen'.

Let’s create a program that keeps track of the way the environment changes with the seasons. Write a conditional statement to make this happen!
In main.js there is already an if...else statement in place. Let’s add an else if statement that checks if season is equal to 'winter'.
Inside the code block of the else if statement, add a console.log() that prints the string 'It\'s winter! Everything is covered in snow.'.

Add another else if statement that checks if season is equal to 'fall'.
Inside the code block of the else if statement you just created, add a console.log() that prints the string 'It\'s fall! Leaves are falling!'.

3.
Add a final else if statement that checks if season is equal to 'summer'.
Inside the code block of the else if statement you just created, add a console.log() that prints the string 'It\'s sunny and warm because it\'s summer!'.

Let’s write a switch statement to decide what medal to award an athlete.
athleteFinalPosition is already defined at the top of main.js. So start by writing a switch statement with athleteFinalPosition as its expression.

2.
Inside the switch statement, add three cases:
The first case checks for the value 'first place'
If the expression’s value matches the value of the case then console.log() the string 'You get the gold medal!'
The second case checks for the value 'second place'
If the expression’s value matches the value of the case then console.log() the string 'You get the silver medal!'
The third case checks for the value 'third place'
If the expression’s value matches the value of the case then console.log() the string 'You get the bronze medal!'
Remember to add a break after each console.log().

3.
Now, add a default statement at the end of the switch that uses console.log() to print 'No medal awarded.'.
If athleteFinalPosition does not equal any value of our cases, then the string 'No medal awarded.' is logged to the console.
Remember to add the break keyword at the end of the default case.
